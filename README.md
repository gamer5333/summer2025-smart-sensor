## Hardware Components

| Component      | Description                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Raspberry Pi   | Model 3B+, 4, or Zero 2 W              |
| DHT11 Sensor   | Temp & Humidity Digital Sensor         |
| Jumper Wires   | Female-to-female recommended           |
| Resistor       | 10kÎ© between VCC and data (pull-up)    |
| Breadboard     | For prototyping                        |

## âš™Wiring Guide

| DHT11 Pin | Connects to Raspberry Pi |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| VCC       | 5V (Physical pin 2 or 4) |
| DATA      | GPIO4 (Physical pin 7)   |
| GND       | GND (e.g., pin 6)        |

Use a **10kÎ© resistor** between VCC and Data for stability.
